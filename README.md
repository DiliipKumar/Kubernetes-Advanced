In Kubernetes, environment variables for your backend application can be managed using several techniques, depending on the nature of the data (e.g., sensitive or non-sensitive). Here's a breakdown of the best practices:

### 1. **Using ConfigMaps**  
For non-sensitive configuration data like database URLs, API endpoints, or other environment-specific variables, you can use **ConfigMaps**. ConfigMaps allow you to decouple configuration artifacts from the application.

#### Steps:
1. Create a ConfigMap:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: backend-config
   data:
     DATABASE_URL: jdbc:mysql://db-service:3306/mydb
     API_ENDPOINT: https://api.example.com
   ```

2. Reference the ConfigMap in your deployment file:
   ```yaml
   containers:
     - name: backend
       image: your-backend-image
       envFrom:
         - configMapRef:
             name: backend-config
   ```

### 2. **Using Secrets**  
For sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or database credentials, Kubernetes **Secrets** are used. Secrets ensure that sensitive data is securely stored and managed.

#### Steps:
1. Create a Secret (base64 encoding is recommended for sensitive data):
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: backend-secrets
   type: Opaque
   data:
     DB_PASSWORD: dXNlcl9wYXNzd29yZA==  # base64 encoded
     API_KEY: YXBpa2V5c2VjcmV0  # base64 encoded
   ```

2. Reference the Secret in your deployment file:
   ```yaml
   containers:
     - name: backend
       image: your-backend-image
       env:
         - name: DB_PASSWORD
           valueFrom:
             secretKeyRef:
               name: backend-secrets
               key: DB_PASSWORD
         - name: API_KEY
           valueFrom:
             secretKeyRef:
               name: backend-secrets
               key: API_KEY
   ```

### 3. **Using Helm for Environment Management**  
If you're using Helm for Kubernetes, managing environment variables can be done dynamically with values files. You can define environment-specific configurations in the `values.yaml` file and refer to them in your deployment templates.

### 4. **Using External Secrets Management Tools**
For highly sensitive data, you can integrate external secrets management solutions like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or Google Secret Manager to fetch environment variables securely.

#### Example using AWS Secrets Manager:
1. Use a tool like **External Secrets Operator** to fetch secrets from AWS Secrets Manager.
2. Reference the secrets directly in your Kubernetes deployment by linking them via External Secrets Operator.

### 5. **Inline Environment Variables**  
For simpler setups, you can define environment variables directly in the Kubernetes Deployment YAML, although this is not recommended for production if the data is sensitive.

```yaml
containers:
  - name: backend
    image: your-backend-image
    env:
      - name: DATABASE_URL
        value: "jdbc:mysql://db-service:3306/mydb"
      - name: API_KEY
        value: "your-api-key"
```

### Summary:
- **ConfigMaps**: For non-sensitive configuration values.
- **Secrets**: For sensitive data.
- **Helm**: For managing environments with templating.
- **External Secrets Management Tools**: For advanced secrets management.
- **Inline environment variables**: For simpler setups (not recommended for sensitive data).

These techniques can be combined for the optimal management of backend environment data in Kubernetes. Would you like an example tailored to your current setup?
